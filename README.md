# Image Compression using 2D-DCT
Description:

JPEG Compression Algorithm aims at reducing the size of image by removing image data that is not sensitive to the human eye while maintaining a reasonable image quality. It is mainly based on Two Dimensional-Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-DCT) and other steps like Chroma Sub-Sampling, Quantization, Run Length encoding and decoding, Huffman encoding and decoding, moving window based Block Processing. 

Programming Language: MATLAB

EDA Tool: MATLAB

Results:

• Two-Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-DCT) based JPEG Image Compression algorithm was implemented and verified. 

• Compression ratio of 26.42:1, PSNR of 31.95 dB and MSE of 0.0007 was achieved at a Q-Factor of 50. 

• Graphs of compression size, compression ratio, PSNR and MSE against varying Q-Factors were plotted and analysed. 

• Implemented on Raspberry Pi 3B to achieve real time image capture and compression up to 60%.
